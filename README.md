# House Pricing Prediction

### House Price prediction can be Very Helpful in decision-making, optimized pricing strategies, and investment in the real estate market

# Dataset:

### Load Boston House Pricing dataset from sklearn


# Overall Steps:
1. Exploring the Dataset(EDA)
2. Applying Polynomial Features
3. Test various Lasso regression models using Cross Validation technique
4. Reguarization parameter tune the best model
5. Analyse the best model with the help of Validation Curve
6. Pickling the best model
7. A sample prediction is made to test the application
8. Build a Web Application using Flask and HTML

# Algorithms Used:
- Linear Regression
- Lasso

# Fine Tuning:
- Column Transformation
- Over Sampling
- Model with different Hyperparameters

# Accuracy Metrics:
- R2Score
- Adjusted R2Score
- mean_absolute_error(MAE)
- mean_squared_error(MSE)

# End Notes:
